            <p><b>1. Admission of Patients</b><br>
              <b>1.1</b> The hospital accepts patients for care and treatment by members of its Medical Staff from its
              service area within the limits of its available resources. Within these guidelines patients are
            admitted without regard to race, color, creed, sex, national origin, age, or ability to pay.<br>
          <b>1.2</b> Only a member in good standing of the active, adjunct or courtesy staff who has been granted
            admitting privileges may admit patients to the hospital subject to all policies as may be in
            effect from time to time. General dentists and oral surgeons may admit patients to the
            hospital as provided under a separate section of those rules and regulations.<br>
            <b>1.3</b> At times of full hospital occupancy or of shortage of hospital beds or other facilities and/or
            personnel, as determined by the Chief Executive Officer, priorities among patients will be
            based on their medical condition as provided by the attending physician to the Admitting
            Office. Whenever patients are admitted as an emergency, the attending credentialed
            physician must provide within eight (8) hours of a patient’s admission to the hospital, an
            admission note which indicates involvement in the immediate care of the patient; and within
            24 hours of the admission, sufficient documentation on the chart to justify the emergency
            admission. The initial assessment/screening of each patient’s physical, psychological and
            social status will determine the need for care and treatment, the type of care or treatment to
            be provided and the need for any further assessment.<br>
          <b>1.4</b>b> Except in Emergency cases, the attending physician shall arrange for a patient to be admitted
            during routine hours as specified by the Admitting Office. Ambulatory Surgery patients must
            comply with hospital policies concerning presurgical laboratory testing, documentation and
            scheduling.<br>
          <b>1.5</b> Except in an emergency, a patient will not be admitted to the hospital until a provisional
            diagnosis or valid reason for admission is provided by the attending physician requesting such
            admission. Other required documentation or information specific to the type of admission
            involved shall be the responsibility of the attending physician. In addition, it is also the
            responsibility of the attending physician to provide information regarding any source of 
            significant communicable disease or infection, behavioral characteristics that would disturb or
            endanger others, and the need for protecting the patient from self-inflicted harm.<br>
          <b>2. Child Abuse and Neglect</b><br>
          <b>2.1</b> Child Abuse and Neglect - Members of the Medical Staff and Graduate Staff shall be
            responsible for reporting suspected abuse and/or neglect of children as soon as possible to
            the Child Protective Services, Central Registry for Mandated Reporters. This physician’s
            responsibility is considered to be met if such reporting is carried out by another service, such
            as the Department of Social Work.<br>
          <b>3. Consent</b><br>
          <b>3.1</b> The attending physician, surgeon, resident or other medical staff member directly involved in
            the care of the patient is responsible for obtaining consent for anesthesia, surgery, blood
            transfusions and other invasive or special procedures after conducting and documenting a
            discussion of relevant risks, benefits, alternatives and expected outcomes of the proposed
            intervention.<br>
          <b>3.2</b> The attending physician shall devote his best efforts to ensuring that such discussions are
            conducted in a way that is understandable to the patient or legal representative. The responsible
            medical staff member shall ensure that an appropriate hospital form documents the
            signature of the individual performing the intervention, the patient or legal representative,
            and a legally competent witness. Except in emergency, the medical staff member performing
            an invasive procedure shall be present when the signatures of the patient (or representative)
            and witness are obtained. Special consent documents are required for experimental drugs,
            organ donations, radiation oncology treatments, autopsy, HIV testing and photography.<br>
          <b>4. Consultation</b><br>
          <b>4.1</b> Good medical practice includes the proper and timely use of consultation. The attending
            physician is primarily responsible for requesting consultation when indicated or required,
            pursuant to the rules of the hospital. Judgment as to the serious nature of the illness and the
            question of doubt as to diagnosis and treatment generally rests with the attending physician.
            <br>
          <b>4.2</b> Except as otherwise provided for by the Medical Board, any qualified member of the medical
            staff with clinical privileges in this hospital may be called for consultation within his/her area
            of expertise. Generally, a consultant is a recognized specialist in the applicable area of need as
            evidenced by either certification or by demonstrated competence, training and experience.
          <br><b>4.3</b> Except in an emergency, consultation is indicated in the following situations, but shall not be
            limited thereto:<br>
          <b>4.3.1</b> In cases where the scope of care needed by the patient is beyond the delineated clinical
            privileges of the practitioner;<br>
          <b>4.3.2</b> In instances in which patients on non-psychiatric units exhibit suicidal tendencies or other
            severe psychiatric symptoms;<br>
          <b>4.3.3</b> For conditions recommended by the Bureau of Maternal and Child Health of the State
            Department of Health;<br>
          <b>4.3.4</b> When requested by the patient or his/her family; or<br>
          <b>4.3.5</b> Those situations specifically designated elsewhere in these Rules and Regulations, or in the
            regulations of the various clinical departments for special care units.<br>
          <b>4.4</b> Consultations by physicians, dentists or podiatrists not on Medical Staff must have temporary
            privileges as defined by Article II, Section 6, Subsection 2 &amp; 3 of the Medical Staff Bylaws, a
            current New York State license, and evidence of competency, which must be assured by the
            pertinent Department Chairman (or designee). Such permission must be recorded in the
            patient’s medical record. Whenever possible, the attending physician, dentist, or podiatrist of
            record or a designee shall be physically present during such consultation.<br>
          <b>4.5</b> When requesting a consultation, it is advisable that the attending physician indicate, in
            writing, the reason for the request and the extent of involvement in the care of the patient
            expected from the consultant, e.g. “for consultation and opinion only” for consultation, orders
            and follow-up with respect to a specific problem. The consultant must make and sign a report
            of his/her findings, opinions and recommendations which reflect an actual examination of the
            patient and the medical record. Such report shall become part of the patient’s permanent 
            medical record. When operative procedures are involved, the consultation note, except in
            emergency cases, shall be recorded prior to the operation.<br>
          <b> 5. Coverage</b><br>
          <b>5.1</b> In order to assure alternate coverage and continuing care, each physician must arrange for
            timely, adequate professional care of his/her patients in the hospital by being available or
            designating qualified alternate practitioner with whom prior arrangements have been made
            and who has the requisite clinical privileges to care for the patient. Each member of the staff
            must arrange for coverage during his/her absence for the care of hospitalized patients. The
            name of the covering physician designated by the attending physician must be readily available
            from a reliable telephone service operator at all times or indicated in the medical record.
            Physicians may not “sign out” to the hospital Emergency Department to cover private office
            patients in their absence. It is the responsibility of the private answering service to contact
            covering physicians when the attending physician has “signed out”.<br>
          <b>6. Discharge of Patients</b><br>
          <b>6.1</b> A patient may be discharged only on the order of the attending physician or assigned resident.
          <b>6.2</b> Multidisciplinary discharge planning begins at the time of hospital admission. The physicianof-record
            or covering designee is solely authorized to discharge patients from the hospital and
            is responsible for medical aspects of the discharge, including Discharge Instructions and a
            post-discharge plan. The responsible physician shall (1) record his instructions in the medical
            record and (2) share these verbally and in writing with the patient and family, addressing at
            least the following (as relevant to the particular case): an explanation to the patient and
            family (as applicable) of the patient’s principle diagnoses and medical problems, major findings
            of tests and investigations, all medications, including any changes from the patient’s
            admitting medications (i.e. medication reconciliation), diet, activity, self-monitoring, follow-up
            tests and appointments inclusive of recommended time frames, and specific reasons for
            seeking urgent care or contacting the physician as they relate to the patient’s known, active
            medical problems. Consulting physicians play an important collaborative role in discharge
            planning, but must coordinate their contributions to the overall discharge plan with the
            physician-of-record or designee. 
            <br>
          <b>7. Discharge AMA</b><br>
          <b>7.1</b> In instances where a patient desires to leave the hospital against the advice of the attending
            physician or without a proper discharge, the attending physician shall be notified and the
            patient will be requested to sign the appropriate release form. Any minor or individual who
            cannot legally consent to his/her own care, or is incapable of providing his/her own care shall
            be discharged only in the custody of a parent, legal guardian, significant other, unless the
            parent or guardian directs that discharge be made otherwise.<br>
          <b>7.2</b> No patient shall be detained in the hospital against his/her will, nor shall a minor under
            eighteen (18) years of age be detained against the will of his/her parent or legal guardian,
            except as authorized by law. In no event shall a patient be detained solely for non-payment of
            the hospital bill or physician statement for medical services. However, it is acceptable to
            attempt to persuade a patient to remain in the hospital in the patient’s own interest. If there
            is a concern that the patient lacks decisional capacity due to mental illness, or that the patient
            may be a danger to self or others, the patient may be temporarily detained pending a prompt
            psychiatric evaluation and determination of the patient’s legal rights. If an adult patient lacks
            capacity for any other reason, and there is no legal guardian or properly designated health
            care agent, Administration shall be consulted. If a presumptively competent patient insists
            upon being discharged against the advice of a member of the medical staff or the graduate
            staff, the patient shall be requested to sign the form entitled “Release for Leaving the Hospital
            Against Advice”. The physician involved is responsible for documenting the facts and circumstances
            surrounding the act of the patient leaving the hospital against medical advice. In the
            event the patient refuses to sign the form, the patient’s refusal must be documented in the
            medical record.<br>
          <b>8. Emergency Department On-Call Roster</b><br>
            Unless specifically exempted by departmental rules or the Medical Board, each member of the
            staff is required to serve on the Emergency Department on-call roster and accepts the responsibility
            for providing care to any patient referred to him/her by the Emergency Department physician
            on duty. The staff member who is on call, as specified by the published schedule, shall be responsible
            for providing post Emergency Department care until the medical care for the condition
            occasioning the Emergency Department visit has been completed. Members of the Medical Staff 
            are specifically prohibited from either requiring that the patient satisfy any financial obligation in
            advance of such follow-up care or refusing to provide follow-up care based upon the ability to pay.
          <br>  
          <b>9. History and Physical Examination</b>
          <b>9.1</b> For patients undergoing scheduled ambulatory procedures or admitted for scheduled elective
            procedures, a legible H&amp;P must be submitted that was created not more than 30 days prior to,
            or within 24 hours after, admission and includes the patient’s history as it relates to the
            presenting problem and other history as relevant, physical examination findings, results of
            relevant investigations, impression, and plan. If the document was created more than 24
            hours prior to a planned invasive procedure, the physician must either (1) attest that the
            patient’s condition is unchanged, based upon appropriate reassessment, or (2) indicate any
            changes in the patient’s condition in the medical record. This report must be signed or
            authenticated, dated and timed prior to surgery or any procedure requiring anesthesia
            services.<br>
          <b>9.2</b> For patients admitted for non-elective reasons, the admitting physician of record or designee
            shall create a legible admission note within eight hours after admission outlining the patient’s
            presenting problem and reason for admission, pertinent history, physical findings, results of
            initial investigations, impression and plan. If this notation is not inclusive of all elements
            required for an Admitting History and Physical as delineated in this section, a complete and
            legible H&amp;P must be created within 24 hours after admission and include the patient’s chief
            complaint, details of the present illness, all relevant past medical, social and family history, a
            review of systems, physical examination findings including, where appropriate, the patient’s
            emotional and behavioral status, results of investigations, and diagnostic impressions. The
            attending physician must indicate the reason for hospitalization and the diagnostic/therapeutic
            plan of care. There must be an initial assessment/ screening of each patient’s physical,
            psychological, and social status to determine the need for care or treatment, the type of care
            or treatment to be provided, and the need for any further assessment.
          <br><b>9.3</b> If the admission history and physical for an operative or invasive procedure are performed by
            a physician who is not a member of the hospital’s medical staff, the attending physician shall
            review the history and physical examination and attest to its accuracy by countersigning.
            Individuals who are not licensed independent practitioners may perform part or all of a 
        
            patient’s medical history and physical examination under the general supervision of the
            attending physician. The attending physician shall review and countersign the history and
            physical examination before the operation or procedure.
          <br><b>9.4</b> A relevant history and physical examination is required for each patient having surgery.
            Except in an emergency, surgery or any other potentially hazardous procedure shall not be
            performed until after the preoperative diagnosis, history, physical examination, and required
            laboratory tests have been recorded in the chart. If the H&amp;P has been dictated but is not on
            the chart at the time of surgery, a written note must be entered into the chart before surgery
            stating the basic nature of the proposed surgery/procedure and the condition for which it is to
            be done. The condition of the heart and lungs, allergies known to be present, other pertinent
            information and pathology relating to the patient, and that the history and physical have been
            dictated are also to be noted. If not recorded, the anesthesiologist shall not allow the surgery
            to proceed. In cases of emergency, the responsible physician shall make at least a comprehensive
            note regarding the patient’s condition prior to induction of anesthesia and start of
            the procedure, and the history and physical examination shall be recorded immediately after
            the emergency surgery has been completed.
          <br><b>9.5</b> The current obstetrical record must include a complete prenatal record. This may be a
            durable, legible copy of the attending physician’s office record transferred to the hospital
            before admission, but an interval admission note must be written which includes pertinent
            additions to the history and any subsequent changes in the physical findings.
            9.6 Dentists are responsible for the part of their patient’s history and physical examination that
            relates to dentistry. A qualified physician must do the admission history and physical.
            9.7 All patients admitted for Podiatric surgery must have a history and physical examination
            performed by a physician member of the active medical staff who shall be responsible for the
            medical care of the patient during his or her stay in the hospital. Such writings shall be
            recorded on the chart prior to the procedure in the OR. No podiatric surgical procedure will
            be allowed until the history and physical has been performed. It will be the Podiatric surgeons’
            significant responsibility to see that that is completed.
            <br><b>10. Indication for Procedure/Surgery</b>
           <br>
          <b>10.1</b> The determination of the appropriateness of any surgical intervention will be based in part
            (or at least) on a review of the patient’s history, a review of the patient’s physical status, a
            review of diagnostic data, and an assessment including the risks and benefits of the procedure,
            the anesthesia to be administered, and the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the
            procedure, including the possible need to administer blood or blood components. Unless
            impossible due to the patient’s condition, the risks, benefits and potential complications
            associated with the procedure and alternate options are discussed with the patient before
            obtaining informed consent.
          <br><b>11. Physician Orders</b><br>
          <b>11.1</b> All orders for the diagnosis and treatment of hospitalized patients must be clear, legible and
            complete. Orders must be signed or electronically authenticated, dated and timed, by the
            attending physician, assigned resident or designated alternate. Orders which are illegible or
            improperly written will not be carried out by the nursing staff.
          <br><b>11.2</b> Telephone orders for drugs and biologicals shall be used sparingly when the medical staff
            member is not readily available on-site, and shall not replace an appropriate medical assessment.
            A registered professional nurse, a pharmacist or a member of the Allied Health Staff
            can transcribe a telephone order when the order is within the scope of their practice. An
            order so transcribed may be carried out by the nurse.
          <br><b>11.3</b> All telephone orders must be authenticated by the prescribing practitioner or designee within
            48 hours of issuing the order, unless the order was issued by a physician’s assistant which
            requires authentication by a supervising physician within 24 hours of issuing the order.
          <br><b>11.4</b> All orders are automatically canceled and discontinued when a patient goes to surgery or is
            transferred to the OR.
          <br><b>11.5</b> The hospital formulary which is approved by the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee and
            the Medical Board lists drugs available for ordering from stock. Each member of the medical
            staff is expected to use the drugs which are available and listed in the formulary as approved
            by the medical staff. Each patient’s medications shall be monitored on an ongoing basis for
            effectiveness and actual or potential adverse effects or toxicity. Use of investigational drugs 
          
            requires prior approval by the Institutional Review Board and must be in full accordance with
            separate rules and regulations of this committee and consistent with regulations of the FDA.
          <br><b>12. Physician of Record</b><br>
          <b>12.1</b> All patients, ambulatory or inpatient will be attended by a mutually consenting practitioner
            of his/her choice to perform the care required, provided said practitioner is a member of the
            Medical Staff and has appropriate clinical privileges and is properly credentialed. A private
            patient who has no personal physician may request a physician who is a member of the
            Medical Staff and who has appropriate clinical privileges. When no such request is made and
            the patient requests assistance in obtaining a physician, the hospital shall assign a member of
            its Medical Staff, based on the Emergency Department on-call roster, consistent with the
            patient’s condition, except for cases requiring General Adult Medicine or Pediatrics in which
            case the patient will be assigned to the hospitalist service. The physician-of-record or covering
            designee shall be responsible for the medical care and treatment of each patient in the
            hospital at all times, for the overall coordination of patient care, the prompt completion and
            accuracy of those portions of the medical record for which they are responsible, for discharge
            planning and for communication of the patient’s condition and plan of care to the patient,
            agent or family as applicable.

            and family medical histories; (c) description and history of present complaint and/or 
                       illness; (d) physical examination; (e) diagnostic orders; (f) evidence of appropriate informed

            that promote recovery and improve outcomes; (l) autopsy report, when available; (m) nursing
            assessments, nursing plans for care, documentation of nursing care provided and results.
            <br><b>2.</b> Pertinent progress notes must be recorded at the time of observation and must be sufficient to
            support continuity of care by explaining the physician’s findings, working diagnoses and plan of
            care. Frequency of progress notes shall be determined on a departmental basis but shall be
            entered at least once daily.
          <br><b>3.</b> Operative and special procedure reports must contain, as applicable, a detailed account of the
            findings, technical procedures used, specimens removed, postoperative diagnosis, and the
            name of the primary performing practitioner and any assistants. If the operative report is
            dictated and not immediately transcribed, the responsible physician must enter a comprehensive
            operative progress note in the medical record immediately after completing the
            procedure which provides sufficient and pertinent information for use by any other physician
            who is involved in the care of the patient. All tissues, foreign bodies, artifacts and prosthesis
            removed during a procedure, except those specifically excluded by policy, shall be properly
            labeled, packaged and sent to the hospital pathologist, who shall document receipt and make
            such examination as is necessary to arrive at a pathological diagnosis. Each specimen must be
            accompanied by pertinent clinical information and, to the degree known, the preoperative and
            postoperative diagnoses. An authenticated report of the pathologist’s examination shall be
            made a part of the medical record.
          <br><b>4.</b> A discharge summary must be recorded for all patients, except those with problems of a minor
            nature requiring less than 48 hours hospitalization; normal newborn infants and patients
            having uncomplicated vaginal deliveries. To affect planned and coordinated care and treat-
            
            ment plans and the rehabilitation that may be necessary after discharge, the discharge
            summary or final progress note must indicate any specific instructions given to the patient
            and/or significant other relating to physical activity, medication, diet and follow-up care. The
            discharge instructions should facilitate patient/family understanding of the patient’s health
            status, health care options, and the consequences of the treatment options selected. If no
            instructions were required, a record entry must be made to that effect.
          <br><b>5.</b> All clinical entries in the patient’s medical record must be accurately dated, timed, and
            individually authenticated.

            resolution of the pertinent Clinical Department and approved by the Medical Board and
            the Board of Directors). Where appropriate, the Medical Board may establish particular
            qualifications required of members of a specific category of AHPs, provided that such
            qualifications are not founded on an arbitrary or discriminatory basis and are in conformance

                requested under Article V of the Medical Staff Bylaws. Unless otherwise defined in these Rules and 
             
                Regulations, all capitalized terms in this Section VI shall have the same meaning as in the Bylaws of
                the Medical Staff.
                <br><b>1. Request for Hearing</b>
              <br><b>1.1</b> A practitioner who has received notice of a request for corrective action as set forth in
                Subsection 5.1.2(A)(vii) through (xi) of Article V of the Medical Staff Bylaws, notice of summary
                action, or an adverse recommendation on an application for appointment or reappointment
                to the Medical Staff, and who desires a hearing before a Hearing Committee with respect to
                such request, action or recommendation, shall do so by submitting a written request for a
                hearing to the Chairman of the Medical Board. Such written request shall be submitted by
                overnight delivery service or personal delivery within thirty (30) days of his/her receipt of
                notice of the request, action or recommendation. If the practitioner fails to request a hearing
                within such time limitation, or to appear at the time set for the hearing, he or she shall be
                deemed to have waived the right to a hearing, as set forth in Subsection 5.1.6 of the Medical
                Staff Bylaws.
              <br><b>1.2</b> If a Medical Staff member is subject to corrective action at both the Hospital and one or more
                other System Hospital(s) where he/she also has clinical privileges, and the corrective actions at
                the hospitals are based on substantially the same facts, then the practitioner shall be entitled
                to request one (1) hearing, the final determination of which shall apply at all the hospitals.
                The hearing and any appeal therefrom shall be requested at, and shall be conducted in accordance
                with the Medical Staff Bylaws and the Rules and Regulations of the hospital where the
                principal facts occurred. If the principal facts occurred at a non-hospital location or at more
                than one hospital, the hearing shall be requested at the hospital designated by the practitioner
                as his/her primary hospital in his/her most recent application for appointment or
                reappointment. All issues relating to the corrective action at all hospitals shall be presented at
                the hearing and any subsequent appeal.
              <br><b>2. CHALLENGES TO THE COMPOSITION OF THE HEARING COMMITTEE.</b> Any challenge by the
                practitioner to any member of the Hearing Committee pursuant to Subsection 5.1.5 shall be
                made in writing to the Chair of the Hearing Committee no less than fifteen (15) days prior to
                the date of the Hearing. If the challenge is regarding the Chair of the Hearing Committee, it
                shall be made by the practitioner to the Chief Executive Officer of the Hospital. 
                
              <br><b>3. Conduct of the Hearing</b>
              <br><b>3.1</b> Not less than five (5) business days prior to the hearing, the practitioner and the Hospital shall
                simultaneously exchange (i) a list of witnesses, including experts, that each intends to call at
                the hearing, together with a brief statement describing the subject matter of each witness’
                testimony and the relevance thereof to the issues in the hearing; and (ii) copies of all exhibits
                that they propose to introduce as evidence at the hearing. If necessary, such exchange may
                be supervised by the Chair of the Hearing Committee. Thereafter, neither party may call any
                additional witness or offer any additional exhibit without the permission of the Chair of Hearing
                Committee upon a showing of good cause as to why the witness or exhibit could not have
                been identified prior to the start of the hearing, such as, for example, where rebuttal evidence
                is offered to respond to the practitioner’s evidence. The exchange of witness lists and exhibits
                shall be without prejudice to either party’s right to object to a witness or exhibit at any time
                on any proper ground. If feasible, however, such objections should be stated and resolved
                prior to the start of the hearing. Prior to the exchange of the witness lists and exhibits as
                described above, the practitioner and the Hospital shall enter into a written and signed agreement,
                in form and substance satisfactory to the Hospital, that ensures the protection of the
                confidentiality of all quality assurance, peer review and protected health information used by
                either party in the course of the hearing and any subsequent internal Hospital reviews and
                appeals and administrative or judicial proceedings.
              <br><b>3.2</b> In consideration of the sensitive nature of the physician-patient relationship, neither the
                practitioner nor the Hospital may call a patient, past or present, to testify on his/her or its
                behalf at the hearing, or offer as evidence any written or oral patient statement solicited or
                obtained for the purposes of the hearing. A statement shall not be deemed to have been
                solicited or obtained for the purposes of the hearing if the statement caused, in whole or in
                part, the corrective action, or was obtained in the course of investigating whether corrective
                action should be requested or taken.
              <br><b>3.3</b> Witnesses may be permitted to testify remotely only upon a showing of good cause as to why
                the witness is unable to be present and a determination by the Chair of the Hearing Committee
                that such remote testimony will not unfairly prejudice the other party or impede the
                Hearing Committee’s ability to evaluate the testimony. Remote testimony shall not be 
               
                permitted if (i) the witness is to be examined or cross-examined with respect to the content or
                authenticity of documents and/or images, or (ii) video of the witness is not available, unless
                the Chair determines that the absence of video would not unfairly prejudice the other party or
                impede the Hearing Committee’s ability to evaluate the testimony. When remote testimony is
                permitted, it shall be the obligation of the party calling the witness to make all technological
                arrangements, and bear the expense thereof, as may be necessary for the transmission,
                receipt and broadcast of the testimony in a manner that ensures that all participants in the
                hearing are able to hear and view (unless the Chair determines that video is not required) the
                witness.
              <br><b>3.4</b> The practitioner must be present at the hearing, and, subject to the limitations set forth in
                paragraphs a), b) and c) above, both the practitioner and the Hospital shall be entitled to
                present relevant evidence and witnesses on his/her or its behalf, to question witnesses
                appearing on behalf of the other party, and to submit a written statement following the close
                of the hearing; provided, however, that neither the practitioner nor the Hospital may present
                a patient as a witness at the hearing. A record of the hearing shall be made by such method as
                shall be determined by the Chair of the Hearing Committee. Such hearing shall not be open to
                the public and documents and testimony shall be maintained in strict confidence by all participants
                and witnesses, consistent with Article 28 of the Public Health Law. The hearing shall not
                be subject to any formal rules of evidence or procedure, and the Hearing Committee may
                permit the presentation of evidence and witnesses subject to such restrictions and limitations
                as it may impose and as may be necessary to avoid cumulative or irrelevant testimony or to
                prevent abuse of the hearing process. There shall be no right to pre-hearing discovery.
                Rulings with respect to evidence and witnesses shall be made by the Chair of the Hearing
                Committee. A majority of the members of the Hearing Committee shall constitute a quorum.
                The practitioner and the Hospital each may elect to be represented at the hearing by legal
                counsel. At its option, the Hearing Committee also may be advised by legal counsel, provided
                that the attorney appointed to advise the Hearing Committee is not the same attorney as the
                attorney representing the Hospital before the Hearing Committee. The Hearing Committee,
                through its Chair, shall make such additional rules as it deems necessary to ensure a fair and 
                
                expeditious handling of the matter. Following the conclusion of the Hearing, both parties may
                submit simultaneously a written statement to the Hearing Committee.
              <br><b>4. Appellate Review Committee</b>
                If a practitioner requests appellate review pursuant to Subsection .1.8 of the Medical Staff Bylaws,
                the Board of Trustees shall appoint an Appellate Review Committee composed of three (3)
                members of the Board of Trustees. A Chair of the Appellate Review Committee shall be appointed
                by the Board of Trustees. Knowledge of the matter involved shall not preclude any person from
                serving as a member of the Appellate Review Committee, so long as that person did not request
                the corrective action or otherwise take part in a prior proceeding on the same matter. For purposes
                of the appellate review, both parties shall have access to the recommendation and record of
                the Hearing Committee, the decision of the Medical Board, and all other material that was considered
                by the Hearing Committee in making its recommendation, unless any such material is
                otherwise exempt from disclosure by law.
              <br><b>5. Appeal Process</b>
                Unless the Chair of the Appellate Review Committee authorizes a different schedule, the party
                requesting appellate review shall submit his/her or its written statement setting forth in full the
                grounds for the appeal and the reasons in support thereof to the Appellate Review Committee and
                to the opposing party within twenty (20) days after the date of receipt by the Board of Trustees of
                the request for appellate review. The opposing party shall submit a responsive statement within
                twenty (20) days of receipt of the appealing party’s statement. After receiving both statements,
                the Chair of the Appellate Review Committee shall schedule a date, time and place for the appellate
                review and shall give written notice of the schedule to the parties. The date of the appellate
                review shall not be more than twenty (20) days from the date that the Appellate Review Committee
                received the opposing party’s statement, unless agreed to by the Chair of the Appellate Review
                Committee and all parties. The Appellate Review Committee shall review the record created at the
                Hearing Committee, the statement of appeal, and the responsive statement for the purpose of
                determining whether the decision of the Medical Board had a rational basis. The Chair of the
                Appellate Review Committee may, in his or her sole discretion, allow oral argument or accept
                additional written evidence, subject to a foundational showing that such evidence could not have
                been made available at the hearing in the exercise of reasonable diligence. New or additional 
                
                matters not raised at the hearing, nor otherwise reflected in the record, shall not be introduced at
                the appellate review unless the Appellate Review Committee, in its sole discretion, decides to
                consider such new matters.
              <br><b>6. Summary Action and Proceedings</b>
                Notice of a summary suspension or restriction of a practitioner’s clinical privileges shall be given to
                the practitioner personally or sent by overnight delivery service as soon as practicable.
              <br><b>7. Withdrawal of Corrective Action</b>
                Any request for corrective action, including a summary action, may be withdrawn by the person
                requesting or imposing it at any time prior to the consideration of the matter by the Hearing Committee.
                Notice of such withdrawal shall be provided to the affected practitioner by the person or
                body withdrawing it.
              <br><b>8. Alternate Medical Coverage</b>
                Immediately upon any termination, limitation or suspension of a practitioner’s Medical Staff
                membership or any termination, limitation or suspension of his or her clinical privileges, either
                under Article III or Article V of the Medical Staff Bylaws and this Section VI of the Rules and Regulations,
                the Department Chair, Chairman of the Medical Board, the Medical Director, or the Chief
                Executive Officer of the Hospital shall each have authority to arrange for alternate medical
                coverage for the practitioner’s patients still in the Hospital. The wishes of the patients concerned
                shall be considered in the selection of an alternate practitioner.
